In Mobile:
1. The texts in bus card gets overlapped.
2. The bus card gets cropped off, after seat selector and bus details, the continue and 1,2,3 steps of booking can't be seen!
3. The swap button between from and to in the search result page makes the search bar component looks huge, the swao button would rather look better between but in the right side such that from and to form field won't be too apart and the component won't look huge and ugly.

Toast messages:
